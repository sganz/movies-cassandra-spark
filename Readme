This project is open source and contains scripts and instruction that:
  1. set up AWS Free Tier account,
  2. launch and ssh into AWS EC2 instance,
  3. download files stored in AWS S3 using AWS Java SDK
  4. perform data ETL and denormalization using Python Pandas
  5. install Docker and build a Cassandra cluster on AWS EC2
  6. create keyspaces and tables in Cassandra
  7. load csv files into Cassandra tables
  8. use Spark and Jupyter to analyze data in Cassandra
  
Data Sources:
1. IMDB datasets: http://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
2. GroupLens datasets: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

Set up AWS Free Tier:
https://aws.amazon.com/free/

1. Click 'Launch instance' button
2. Select a prefered Amazon Machine Image (AMI), e.g. Amazon Linux AMI, which is free for free tier subscription
3. Select an instance type. Different types have different CPU, RAM, storage and prices. t2.micro is free for free tier subscription, pleace see pricing for other instance types here: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/
4. Review and launch

ssh into AWS EC2 instance:
1. Go to EC2 Dashboard
2. Click 'Key Pairs' under 'Resources' section
3. Click 'Create Key Pair' and input a name for the new key pair e.g. test
4. A pem file will be automatically downloaded, which is your key
5. Click 'Instances' on left menu

7. Click 'Actions' -> 'Connect'
8. Copy the ssh command under 'Examples' section, which should look like:
    ssh -i "test.pem" ec2-user@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-x.xxx.compute.amazonaws.com
9. Open your cmd, type following command (replace test.pem with your the name of your pem file):
    chmod 400 test.pem
